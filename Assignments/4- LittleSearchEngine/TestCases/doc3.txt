Red and green are primary colors. An apple is some times green in color. Red is my favorite
color. I like Orange too.
Sunset is orange in color. The Sun's color turns red towards the end though. An apple a day
keeps a doctor away,
they say. Would you like to have a red apple? Apple is a famous company too. Apple makes macs
and iphones, with a
color preference that leans toward black and white, rarely red.
Have you seen the new red Apple ipod? Do you drive a red car? I prefer to go to work by bus. I
can read a book
on a bus. Bus service is a mass-transit system. Car is not. Most of the times, going by car is
faster. A car
drive is also relaxing and fun. Do you own a car? How much does a car cost? Car; is a nice
vehicle.
There; I end it, car.
